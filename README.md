# **Cloud Computing Sudoku Puzzle Solver**

**Programming Languages:**
Java

**API's:** 
MASS

**Description:**
This project showcases a parallel computing approach to solving a large collection of Sudoku puzzles. The solution is implemented in Java using the MASS API and runs across multiple computers, with a maximum of four computing nodes executing concurrently.

# **Custom 2D/3D Graphics Engine:**

**Programming Languages:** 
C++, OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL)

**API's:**
OpenGL - Graphics Backend

GLFW - Keyboard and mouse input 

GLM - Matrix  Calculation

stb_image - Image/texture loading

FreeType - Font processing

SoLoud - Sound backend

ReactPhysics3D - Collision and physics simulation

**Description:**
A custom engine that displays and manipulates objects in a virtual space. The engine also takes keyboard input,  processes fonts, detects object collision, and plays sound. The objects in the engine can be customized using custom models and images. Text in the engine is built using the font provided by the user and the texts size, color, and position is customizable.

# **Unity 3D Mesh Manipulation, Shading, and Lighting:**

**Programming Languages:** C#

**API:** Unity Engine

**Description:** Renders a 3D plane that can be manipulated at points and diffusely shaded based on point position. The user can also modify the position, size, and rotation of the planes texture. Lastly the resolution slider increases/decreases the amount of points on the given plane. Moving the slider after making adjustments resets the plane back to a flat horizontal position.  The menu in the top left hand corner allows the user to switch to a cylinder and make the same adjustments to the objects points.
